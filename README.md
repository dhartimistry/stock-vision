# stock-vision
This repository contains the implementation of a time series forecasting model for stock price prediction using the ARIMA algorithm. The model leverages historical stock price data and exogenous features to make accurate predictions. 

# Usage
- Run Jupyter Notebook.
- Open the StockVision.ipynb file.
- Train the Model: Run the training cells in the Jupyter notebook to build the ARIMA model.
- Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict stock prices. Modify the test_data to input different datasets.
- Evaluate Performance: Performance metrics are displayed in the notebook after predictions.

# Technologies
- Python
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)

# Features
- ARIMA-based model for stock price prediction.
- Utilizes historical stock price data and exogenous features.
- Data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and handling missing values.
